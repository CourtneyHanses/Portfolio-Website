                    <p>AIGA: The goal of this assignment was to create a poster promoting the AIGA Design Conference using the design style of another thing that exists in the world. I chose to base mine off of comic covers from the middle-to-late 20th century. To achieve this, I referenced the things such as the heading and typefaces in the images I found online. I tried to cleverly implement the information about the conference in a way that stuck with the comic book theme. I also experimented with using type blocks as shapes in the portrait in the top left and barcode towards the bottom.</p> 
                    <p>TYPOGRAPHERS: The goal of this assignment was to implement a hierarchy using pre-written text about some of the typographers from history. I chose to put the names of the designers at the top, followed by their home countries, the years they were alive, and the body copy last. Another part of the assignment was to incorporate rhythm and reversible figure/ground. To achieve this, I created a bunch of slightly rotated rectangles and staggered them.</p> 
                    <p>INFORMATIC: I conducted a survey on what colors people associate with the vowels. I visualized that data by changing the scale of the letters to reflect the results. Right away, you can see what letters had general consensus and which ones were more split. I typed out more data and played with the letter weight and kerning to create emphasis and add to the organized-chaos effect of the piece.</p>
