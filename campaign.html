                <p>Over the summer, my dad had someone running against him in the election primaries for the county. I designed many assets for him, including a palm card, newpaper ads, business cards, and postcards. Since I made so many things, it helped me with creating a cohesive identity with design elements.</p>
                <p>It was a bit of a challenge to include everything he requested without overcrowding the page. To achieve this, I played with visual hierarchy by changing the point sizes and font weights. There is a lot of writing, but I made sure to make the more important words larger so the eye has somewhere to go to instead of being swamped by long blocks of text.</p>
